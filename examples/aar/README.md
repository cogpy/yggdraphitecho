# Agent-Arena-Relation (AAR) Examples

Examples demonstrating the AAR cognitive architecture for self-awareness and agent modeling.

## Examples

- **demo_aar_system.py** - Basic AAR system demonstration
- **demo_arena_simulation_framework.py** - Arena simulation and environment modeling
- **demo_echo_aar_integration.py** - Integration of Echo systems with AAR architecture

## Concepts

The AAR architecture provides:
- Agent modeling and self-representation
- Arena (environment) modeling
- Relation dynamics between agent and arena
- Geometric approach to self-awareness

## Usage

```bash
python3.11 demo_aar_system.py
```
